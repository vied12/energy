        <h2>Why 2014 Was the Year of energy</h2><p>Measurement of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-dimensional black body can provide an accurate temperature measurement because the frequency of maximum spectral radiance of black-body radiation is directly proportional to the temperature of the black body; this is known as Wien's displacement law, and has a theoretical explanation in Planck's law and the Bose–Einstein law.</p><p>More broadly, living organisms require available energy to stay alive; humans get such energy from food along with the oxygen needed to metabolize it.</p><p>Energy is never destroyed during a process; it changes from one form to another (see First Law of Thermodynamics).</p><p></p><p>Infrared radiation is popularly known as "heat radiation"</p><p>The nanometre was formerly known as the millimicrometre&nbsp;– or, more commonly, the millimicron for short&nbsp;– since it is 1/1000 of a micron (micrometre), and was often denoted by the symbol mµ or (more rarely) µµ. In 1960, the U.S.</p><p></p><p>Developments in mass spectrometry led to the adoption of oxygen-16 as the standard substance, in lieu of natural oxygen.</p><p>The term micron and the symbol µ were officially accepted for use in isolation to denote the micrometre, between 1879 and 1967, but officially revoked by the International System of Units (SI) in 1967. This was necessary because that older usage became incompatible with the official adoption of the unit prefix micro-, denoted µ, during the creation of the SI in 1960.</p><p>Oxygen-16 (16O) is a stable isotope of oxygen, having 8 neutrons and 8 protons in its nucleus.</p><p>Another application is in paleotemperature measurement for Paleoclimatology.</p><p>India was one of the last countries to start a metrication programme before the advent of SI.</p><p>The Quaternary sub-era includes the current climate.</p><p>Glaciation took place repeatedly during the Quaternary Ice Age&nbsp;– a term coined by Schimper in 1839 that began with the start of the Quaternary about 2.58 Mya and continues to the present-day.</p><p>Since its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a lead role in the Non-Aligned Movement. In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of neighbouring countries: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a coup d'état attempt in Maldives.</p><p>The movement accepts the universality of human rights and social justice, but fiercely resists cultural homogenisation. In line with its views on sovereignty, the organisation appeals for the protection of cultural diversity, and the tolerance of the religious, socio-cultural, and historical particularities that define human rights in a specific region.</p><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Non-Aligned_Movement_%28emblem_-_South_Africa_Conference%29.png/400px-Non-Aligned_Movement_%28emblem_-_South_Africa_Conference%29.png" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Non-Aligned_Movement_%28emblem_-_South_Africa_Conference%29.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Non-Aligned_Movement_%28emblem_-_South_Africa_Conference%29.png 2x" data-file-width="400" data-file-="" width="400"><p class="thumbcaption">
